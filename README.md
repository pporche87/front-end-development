### Intermediate Front-End Development Projects 

* Build a Random Quote Machine

Instead of building a random quote machine, I built a random tarot card generator. I used the first 22 cards in the Osho Zen Tarot deck to set up my data, and included the first sentence description as well as an image of the card. 
   
* Show the Local Weather 
* Build a Wikipedia Viewer
* Use the Twitch.tv JSON API

There were some issues with the API changing and being restricted to some routes without an API key. 

### Advanced Front-End Development Projects

* Build a JavaScript Calculator 

I added both a JavaScript Calculator according to FCC recommendations (doesn't take into acount order of operations). I also added a Tip Calculator I build in another program I was working on. 

* Build a Pomodoro Clock 

This would be a great project to refactor. I followed along with this project and see some great opportunities to break this code down into modular reusable portions. There is a fair amount of duplication. 

* Build a Tic Tac Toe Game [done - webdevbootcamp]
* Build a Simon Game
